## Home page copy for Bugmark (needs layout)

# Welcome to Bugmark

Bugmark is a market that connects people who want better software to the people
who can build it.

In order to make open collabration more effective, we are using
simple market mechanisms to add incentives to do useful work.



# Bugmark allows you to

1. Put financial value directly in the hands of the 
people who can fix the software issues that are most
important to you.

2. Discover which issues really matter to your project's users.

3. Work with open source practices and not against them.  
Solve part of a problem and still get paid, instead of 
contending to claim credit for a bounty payment.


# How you can get involved



## Find an issue, fix it, and earn money

Vist Bugmark to find an open issue that matches
your skills and interests.  Buy a futures contract
connected to that issue that will pay you when
the issue is fixed.  Work on the issue, in the
open&mdash;then decide if you want to hold your
contract until maturity, or sell it at a profit.


## Report an issue and pay to reward others to fix it

Create a new issue on the project bug tracker, or
select an existing one.  Buy a futures contract on
that issue that will cost you a known amount when the
issue is fixed, or pay you to compensate you if the
issue goes unfixed.  Reduce your exposure to software
risks by directly signaling the project participants
about what issues are important to you.


## Invest in futures on an open source market

Development isn't the only task required to make a
software project a success.  You can trade futures
to earn a profit from other vital tasks, such as
clarifying and translating bug reports, triaging bugs,
writing failing tests, or doing code reviews.
